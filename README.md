# was-action for FedCloud

Tenable's WAS action ![Build](https://github.com/tenable/was-action/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This action can be used to trigger a Tenable WAS scan in the FedCloud environment. The scan needs to be configured in the Tenable.io WAS dashboard. The scan name and the folder name
need to be provided as input for the action to launch the scan. The action does not modify the scan configuration.
The `wait_for_results` optional input can be used to make the action wait for the results of the scan.

Note: <b>It is important to modify `OVERALL SCAN MAX TIME` on the Tenable.io dashboard as per your organization's requirements as the `wait_for_results` input will make the action wait for the entire duration of the scan.</b>

### Example workflow

```yaml
name: Test WAS workflow
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Runs the WAS scan
        uses: tenable/was-action@v0
        id: was
        with:
          scan_name: test_scan
          wait_for_results: "true"
        env:
          ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_KEY }}
          SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.SECRET_KEY }}
```

### Inputs

| Input                                             | Description                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `scan_name`  | Scan name mentioned on Tenable.io  |
| `folder_name`   | Folder name in which the scan resides |
| `wait_for_results` _(optional)_   | Boolean to specify if action should wait for results |
| `check_thresholds` _(optional)_  | If the action should check results against the set thresholds |
| `low_vulns_threshold` _(optional)_  | Low severity findings threshold to be checked based on the WAS scan results |
| `medium_vulns_threshold` _(optional)_  | Medium severity findings threshold to be checked based on the WAS scan results |
| `high_vulns_threshold` _(optional)_  | High severity findings threshold to be checked based on the WAS scan results |
| `critical_vulns_threshold` _(optional)_  | High severity findings threshold to be checked based on the WAS scan results |

### Outputs

| Output                                             | Description                                        |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `number_of_low_severity_findings`  | Number of low severity findings found in the scan |
| `number_of_medium_severity_findings`  | Number of medium severity findings found in the scan |
| `number_of_high_severity_findings`  | Number of high severity findings found in the scan|
| `number_of_critical_severity_findings`  | Number of critical severity findings found in the scan|

### Providing secrets

The access key and secret key can be generated by accessing `Tenable.io -> Settings -> My Account -> API Keys -> Generate` in the UI.
The Tenable.io access key and secret key then need to be set in your repository secrets.
The action uses these secrets to push the image to the Tenable registry and to get the scan results.

They are provided the following way:
```yaml
    env:
        ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_KEY }}
        SECRET_KEY: ${{ secrets.SECRET_KEY }}
```

! It is important that these keys should not be shared publicly.

### Using outputs

The outputs can be accessed using the following way

```yaml
    - name: Gets the number of low severity findings
    run: echo "Number of low severity findings is ${{ steps.was.outputs.number_of_low_severity_findings }}"
    - name: Gets the number of medium severity findings
    run: echo "Number of medium severity findings is ${{ steps.was.outputs.number_of_medium_severity_findings }}"
    - name: Gets the number of high severity findings
    run: echo "Number of high severity is ${{ steps.was.outputs.number_of_high_severity_findings }}"
```
